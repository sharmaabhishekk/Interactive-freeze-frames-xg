                <p class="question">What is this site?</p>
                <p class="answer"> 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>xG Playground</strong> is a <strong>fully interactive, opposition-aware xG simulator</strong>. </li>
                        <li>Use the tactics board above to move the <strong>ball</strong>, <strong>defenders</strong> and <strong>goalkeeper</strong>, and the xG of the scenario will update in real time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <div class="separator"></div>

                <p class="question">How does the xG model work?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most xG models <strong>don&#39;t consider opposition defender and goalkeeper location</strong> when calculating xG. Even the more advanced models typically only consider the <strong>density of defenders between the ball and the goal</strong>, and <strong>whether or not the goalkeeper is out of position</strong>. </li>
                        <li>This model uses a machine learning technique called <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks</strong> (CNNs) to attempt to understand <em>the spatial relationships between the exact location of the ball, defenders, and the goalkeeper and how it relates to xG</em>.</li>
                        <li>The architecture of the model is shown below, and you can read a more thorough description of the motivation and application of CNNs to xG modelling <a href="https://www.opengoalapp.com/xg-with-cnns-full-study">here</a>.</li>
                    </ul>

                </div>
                </p>
                <div class="separator"></div>

                <p class="question">How accurate is the model?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Model accuracy compares favourably to leading xG models e.g. from StatsBomb over thousands of test shots. Check out the <a href="https://www.opengoalapp.com/xg-with-cnns-full-study">blog</a> for a more detailed <strong>evaluation report</strong> of the model.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><p>However, non-intuitive results for individual shot situations are common. In addition, this model does not consider important input variables such as whether the shot was taken <strong>first time</strong>, <strong>shot height</strong>, and <strong>shooter orientation and pose</strong> (e.g., whether the shooter is shooting on the turn). Something to bear in mind if you&#39;re looking to recreate a specific scenario from match footage!</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <div class="separator"></div>

                <p class="question">Why does the xG change when I move players behind the ball?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    <ul>
                        <li>You might reasonably expect that when <strong>moving defenders that we know have no bearing on the probability of a shot resulting in a goal</strong>, the model xG should not change. </li>
                        <li>With this model, that might not always be the case. This behaviour stems from the fact that like many neural networks, the <em>model doesn&#39;t actually understand the system being modelled</em>.</li>
                        <li>That is, it doesn&#39;t know what football is, or what a <strong>good chance</strong> looks like in the way a human does. It has simply learned how to create a <em>good approximation of shooting chance quality on shots it hasn&#39;t seen before</em>. This is a crucial difference that is important to remember with AI as a whole!</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <div class="separator"></div>

                <p class="question">Why do I get a ridiculously high/low xG in unusual scenarios?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    <ul>
                        <li>The model has tried to learn how valuable shooting chances are based only on a <strong>mid-sized set</strong> of real-life shots.</li>
                        <li>So like many machine learning models it is good at predicting on unseen inputs from within the same distribution of the training set - realistic, common shot scenarios - but is <em>basically guessing when it comes to inputs that differ considerably from those seen when training</em> - unrealistic or less common shot scenarios. </li>
                        <li>This is why, achieving high quality model performance across all possible input scenarios is huge challenge!</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <div class="separator"></div>

                <p class="question">Do you have plans to improve the model?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yes, there are plans to improve the <strong>flexibility of the model</strong> and <strong>web app</strong> to allow the user to <strong>add/remove players</strong>, specify additional inputs such as whether or not the shot is a <strong>header</strong>, <strong>direct free kick</strong>, and other characteristics.</li>
                        <li>These additions plus general model accuracy improvements would be reliant however on more, <strong>well-rounded training data</strong> being available. </li>
                        <li>Although this model is trained on the incredibly generous <strong>StatsBomb open data shot freeze frames</strong>, the training data is a mixture of both <strong>men&#39;s and women&#39;s football</strong>. Not to mention a large chunk of shots are taken by <strong>Lionel Messi</strong>! The first thing to try could be to add more training data from StatsBombâ€™s latest <a href="https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data">data release</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <div class="separator"></div>

                <p class="question">Can I make a web app like this myself?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yes! The code for both the model and the web app is publicly available. Visit the <a href="https://github.com/sharmaabhishekk/Interactive-freeze-frames-xg">github repository</a> and clone it. You&#39;ll find all the HTML, CSS and Javascript for this site in there. </li>
                        <li>Next, take a look at this <a href="./notebooks/xG_playground_model.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a> to train your own CNN xG model and save it in a web-friendly format. All you then need to do is make the site look how you want, drop your own model in, and you&#39;re done!</li>
                    </ul>
